      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so, for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let&rsquo;s go over the information that we collect.</p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>It&rsquo;s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depend on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:</p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul style="margin-left:8px;">
          <li><strong>Membership Bot Information</strong>: If you use our Services to sell products or services to others through your membership bot built with FanPlusOne Platform, you will have to create a FanPlusOne project (or several) and provide us with some information to make your membership bot work. This may include the&nbsp;project name, description, resources (like private Telegram channels and supergroups), subscription plans (names, description, prices, included resources). You may also provide us with some extra information about your account at a&nbsp;3rd-party payment provider to set up an integration.</li>
          <li><strong>Content Information</strong>: Depending on the Services you use, you may also provide us with information about you in the&nbsp;draft and published content (such as for your membership bot). For example, if you write your membership bot description that includes biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to the Internet.</li>
          <li><strong>Credentials:</strong> Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with e-mail, country, credentials for your Telegram bot (API token), and your payment provider accounts.</li>
          <li><strong>Communications With Us</strong>: You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our team about a support question, or post a question about your site in our public forums.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><strong>Information We Collect Automatically</strong></p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul style="margin-left:8px;">
          <li><strong>Log Information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services, for example, when you browse our website or create/make changes to your membership bots with @FanPlusOneBot.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage Information</strong>: We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that membership bot administrators and users perform, in other words, who did what, when, and to what thing on our website, our Telegram bot (@FanPlusOneBot) or membership bots built with FanPlusOne Platform (e.g., [Telegram user ID] created a new subscription plan &ldquo;[title of the&nbsp;plan]&rdquo; at [time/date]). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.</li>
          <li><strong>Information from Cookies &amp; Other Technologies</strong>: A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor&rsquo;s computer, and that the visitor&rsquo;s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. FanPlusOne uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and deliver targeted ads.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><strong>Information We Collect from Other Sources</strong></p>
      <ul style="margin-left:8px;">
          <li>Telegram Profile: When you open @FanPlusOneBot (or one of our user`s membership bots for the first time) or log in using Telegram Login Widget on our website, we collect information about your Telegram profile that we receive from Telegram. This includes your Telegram user ID and may include your first and last name, username, and language code.</li>
          <li>Payment providers: We may also get information from payment providers that you integrate with FanPlusOne Platform in order to accept payments from your customers with your membership bot. For example, if you connect your payment provider account (like Stripe via Stripe Connect), we will receive information from that service (such as API keys, account ID) via the authorization procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><strong>Information We Do Not Collect</strong></p>
      <ul class="decimal_type" style="margin-left:8px;">
          <li>Payment Information: FanPlusOne does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world (like Stripe). It is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details. Neither FanPlusOne nor Telegram has access to this information. Although we work with payment providers they are completely independent of FanPlusOne. Please study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.</li>
          <li>We do not collect or process any sensitive data, that is also prohibited by Art. 9 GDPR, unless it is required by applicable law of jurisdiction, for example, in the event of court order. Under most circumstances, the types of data listed below will not be processed:</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
          <li>race or ethnic origin;</li>
          <li>political opinions;</li>
          <li>religious or philosophical beliefs;</li>

      </ul>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><strong>How And Why We Use Information Purposes for Using Information</strong></p>

      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><strong>Sharing Information How We Share Information</strong></p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>We do not sell our users&rsquo; private personal information. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul style="margin-left:8px;">
          <li><strong>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors</strong>: We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</li>
          <li><strong>Third-Party Vendors</strong>: We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, and data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers), and companies that make products available on our websites, who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific policies.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Requests</strong>: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
          <li><strong>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others</strong>: We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of FanPlusOne, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>
          <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that FanPlusOne goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that are transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
          <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so.</li>
          <li><strong>Aggregated or De-Identified Information</strong>: We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><strong>Information Shared Publicly</strong></p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>Information that you choose to make public is disclosed publicly. That means, of course, that information like your membership bot name, URL and description, set of subscription plans with names, prices, and list of included benefits, are all available to others. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.</p>

      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><strong>How Long We Keep Information</strong></p>
      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it, which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information, and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.</p>

      <p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-family:"SF Pro Text",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks. To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable advanced security settings, like Two-Step Authentication in Telegram.</p>
